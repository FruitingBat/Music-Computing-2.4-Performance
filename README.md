# Music-Computing-2.4-Performance
A simple 8 step sequencer designed for live improvised sequencing, created in openFrameworks with ofxMidi and ofxTimer. Features such as step repeating, step skipping, variable playback direction and sequencer reset helps overcome the limitation of 8 steps.
The installer can be used for installation on Windows else the user will have to compile the openFrameworks project themselves.

* Bug Note: Sequencer mode 4 does not work as intended, behaves like sequencer mode 3 instead *
